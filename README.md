(week-1)
This is basic polynomial regression based code. In this the salary of employee is being predicted basesd on thieir level.
For more information please check the graph genreated from ML code.
(week-2)
This is basic multiple linear regression code. In this the profit is predicted using regression.
For more information please check the compared ouput genreated from ML code.
(week-3)
This file contains multiple algorithm implementation. In this project i have predicted whether the user click the ad or not using following algorithms:
● Logistic Regression
● K Nearest Neighbour
● Support Vector Machine (linear kernel)
● Kernel SVM (rbf or polynomial kernel)
● Naive Bayes
● Decision Tree Classification
● Random Forest Classification
The performance of the model can be evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score
and choose the model which has a high accuracy score.
(week-4)
This file contains k- means clustering and hierarchical clusterinng algorithm implementation. The customer dataset is grouped based on similarity.
For more information please check the compared ouput genreated from ML code.
